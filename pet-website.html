    <h1> Facts</h1>
    <p> Heres some info about my cat, Luna:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Luna just turned 1 year old this Month</li>
      <li>She is a Tortoiseshell cat, and has a j-hook pattern on her nose & left eye</li>
      <li>We got her from a shelter, so she was born on the street</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Crazy </h1>
    <p>Because she was born on the street, she learned to play rough.  This means that when she plays, she goes
    for the kill.  Claws will be released, and teeth will be used, but thats half the fun while playing with her.  Her favorite toy is a simple sting toy, and she will attack it like her life depends on it.
     Recently, she has become an indoor and outdoor cat, so she now burns most of her energy outside.
   Even though she saounds crazy, shes a goofball and a lovebug at heart, and I love her for that.</p>
